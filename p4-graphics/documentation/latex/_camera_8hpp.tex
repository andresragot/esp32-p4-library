The Camera class provides functionality to log camera information, calculate normals for faces, and determine visibility of faces based on their orientation relative to the camera. It uses GLM (Open\+GL Mathematics) for vector and matrix operations, and includes methods for calculating normals and checking face visibility. \begin{DoxyVersion}{Version}
