This file implements the Extrude\+Mesh class, which manages the extrusion of a mesh in 3D space. The Extrude\+Mesh class inherits from the Mesh class and provides methods to generate vertices and faces for the extruded mesh. It also includes methods for culling faces based on the camera\textquotesingle{}s view direction and logging mesh information.

The Extrude\+Mesh class is designed to create a 3D mesh by extruding a 2D shape along a specified height. It uses the GLM library for vector and matrix operations, and includes functionality for face culling based on the camera\textquotesingle{}s view direction. The class also provides a method to log detailed information about the mesh, including its position, rotation, scale, and vertex data. \begin{DoxyVersion}{Version}
