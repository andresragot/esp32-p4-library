The Frame\+Buffer class provides methods to create a frame buffer, swap buffers, clear the buffer, fill it with a color, set and get pixels, and manage Open\+GL textures. It supports both single and double buffering modes. The class is designed to be used in graphics applications where rendering performance and buffer management are crucial. \begin{DoxyVersion}{Version}
