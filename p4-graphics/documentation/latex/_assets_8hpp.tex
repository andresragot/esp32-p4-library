This file defines the Assets class, which manages the asset paths for the application. It provides a singleton instance to access asset paths based on the executable\textquotesingle{}s location. The class initializes the base path for assets depending on whether the build is in debug or release mode. It also provides a method to retrieve the full path of an asset by its name.
